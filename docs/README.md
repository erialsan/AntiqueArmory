### DISCLAIMER: You will need [Tinkers' Antique](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-antique) for this mod to work and not Tinkers' Construct!

Antique Armory is an unofficial continuation of Construct's Armory by TheIllusiveC4. This continuation features fixes to issues from the original mod, quality of life and small content additions. It is an add-on mod for Tinkers' Antique that adds four armor items: Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, and Boots. These armor types can be customized just like the tools from Tinkers' Antique, allowing you to make different armor parts out of different materials in order to form a completely custom armor item.

# Getting Started

All of the information you'll need is located in the in-game book, titled "Materials and You - Armory Addendum". If your game is configured to give you the Materials and You book on spawn, it will also give you this addendum at the same time. If not, the crafting recipe is simply:

This book will have information about the new tinkering tables you'll need, the Armor Station and the Armor Forge, as well as information about the material stats and available modifiers.

# Future Plans

- More armor types or cosmetics (maybe)
- Shields that will differentiate from battlesigns

# Mod Integration

- [Tinkers' Tool Leveling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-tool-leveling) - Armor will have the ability to level up and gain experience like tools can.
